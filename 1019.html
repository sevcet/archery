    Bows and arrows are the main constituents of archery. Bows are of different types such as Longbow, shortbow, flatbow, recurve bow, crossbow and compound bow.

The limb of the Flatbow is wider and the cross-section is rectangular in shape.</p>

    </p>
<p>Shortbow is shorter in length; it is light weight and has a short range. It was basically used for hunting purpose.  In crossbow the limbs are mounted in a horizontal manner and not in a vertical manner. The compound bow is designed in such as manner that the archer is at ease while mounting the bow.</p>
    <p>All these types of bows are available in the market.  Although some of the bows have become outdated still some of the archery suppliers keep the product for the satisfaction of their customers.</p>
    <p>Shaft, arrowheads, nock and fletching constitute an arrow.  Aluminum alloy, carbon fiber, wood and fiberglass are used for the construction of the shaft.  Depending on the usage the choice of the arrow will differ from person to person. </p>

    <p>At present arrows made of carbon alloys are popular and are being widely used by the archers.  In fact arrows used in popular sports events like Olympic are made of carbon alloys.</p>
    <p>The arrow will be able to hit the target only when it is shot at a proper angle; when the arrow is in the air it should be able to use the air pressure to reach the target.  The arrowhead and fletching provides the requisite balance to the arrow. </p>
    <p>The arrowhead of archery arrows needs to be made of some hard materials like metals.  The arrowheads heads plays a pivotal role in shooting the target.  Fletching provides balance to the arrows; it is generally made of plastic or bird feathers. Fletching is at the rear end of the arrow and it helps in the projectile motion of the arrow.</p>
    <p>Today archery has become a sporting activity; some even use it for recreational purposes. If you are the one who is excited about archery then the archery supplies will take care of all your needs.</p>
